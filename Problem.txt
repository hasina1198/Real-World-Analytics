A factory makes three products (fabrics): Summer, Autumn, and Winter from three
materials containing: Cotton, Wool and Viscose. The following table provides details
on the sales price, production cost and purchase cost per ton of products and materials
respectively.
        Sales price    Production cost              Purchase price
Summer      $50           $4              Cotton        $30
Autumn      $55           $4              Wool          $45
Winter      $60           $5              Viscose       $40
The maximal demand (in tons) for each product, the minimum cotton and wool propor-
tion in each product is as follows.
         Demand    min Cotton proportion      min Wool proportion
Summer    4500          60%                         30%
Autumn    4000          60%                         30%
Winter    3800          40%                         50%
Formulate a LP model for the factory that maximises the prot, while satisfying the
demand and the cotton and wool proportion constraints.
Solve the model using IBM ILOG CPLEX. What are the optimal prot and optimal
values of the decision variables?
