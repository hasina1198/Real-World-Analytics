LP Model
Minimize the Objective function: z = 6*x + 5*y
Subject To:
-2*x+2*y<=0
3.5*x â€“ 0.5*y>=0
-1*x+2*y>=0
x + y>=50
x , y>=0
The Optimal Solution
z = 275
x = 25, y = 25 and x=33.33 and y=16.67 are the intersection points.
Minimum value of z is obtained with x=25 and y=25. 
Hence minimum cost of the product is $ 275
